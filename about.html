        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Hello! We are a group of Cornell students who study the impact of technology on our surrounding
            ecosystems –
            both human and natural. Having played an integral role in the development of our generation, also known as
            “iGen", technology has special meaning to us. But, in many ways, it's also had a devasting impact on the
            environment
            around us and on the
            people
            involved in the production of devices we often use without second thought. </p>
        <p> As an interdisciplinary team, we're
            focused on finding creative ways to educate the
            public about their technology consumption ... and about the ramifications that computing, especially
            regarding sourcing and extraction, has on a
            global scale. </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <div class="mission-container">
            <div class="mission">
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p> We believe that spreading awareness about the tribulations of sourcing and extraction,
                    a process that is currently a cataclysmic part of the production of our devices,
                    is the first step in creating tangible change. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mission">
                <h3> Motivation </h3>
                <p> Our utlimate goal is simple: motivate people to act. We want to encourage users to be more mindful
                    when making technology purchases, and to push for policy change that can improve the environmental
                    and human impacts of sourcing and extraction. We believe that by coming together and speaking out,
                    we can drive positive change and create a more just and equitable world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mission">
                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p> We hope to inspire other people to take on their own projects when it comes to computing on earth.
                    Look for wacky and wonderful ways to take action in your own lives to better your surrounding
                    community. Nothing is too big or too small.
