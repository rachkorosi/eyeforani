        <h2>the smartphone sustainability nutrition label</h2>
        <p> Our smartphones have become an essential part of our daily lives, but the production process behind these
            devices has a hidden cost. To raise awareness about the environmental, social, and ethical impacts of
            smartphone
            production, we've created the Smartphone Sustainability Nutrition Label sticker. This unique sticker can be
            placed on the back of your phone, visually outlining the resources and methods involved in producing a
            smartphone and highlighting the need for change.</p>

            <h2> the story </h2>
            <h3> the label reveals the hidden impacts of smartphone production:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Resource Extraction: Mining for metals like aluminum, copper, cobalt, gold, silver, platinum, and
                    rare earth metals contributes to land degradation, habitat loss, and deforestation. For instance,
                    coltan
                    mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been linked to the destruction of gorilla habitats.
                </li>

                <li> Pollution: Toxic chemicals used in extraction and production processes generate hazardous waste,
                    contaminating soil and water sources. Greenhouse gas emissions from smartphone production,
                    transportation, and marketing contribute to climate change.</li>

                <li> Labor Conditions: In some countries,
                    child labor is employed in mines and factories for the
                    extraction and processing of metals. Workers often face exposure to toxic substances, long hours,
                    low
                    wages, and poor safety standards.</li>

                <li> Conflict Minerals: Some minerals used in smartphones are sourced from conflict zones, where their
                    extraction finances armed groups and perpetuates violence.

                <li> E-waste: The short lifespan of smartphones and frequent upgrades generate electronic waste, much of
                    which is improperly disposed of, leading to soil and water pollution.
                </li>
            </ol>
