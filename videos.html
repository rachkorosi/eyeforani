    <h2> video one: overconsumption </h2>
    <p> Our first video tells the story of overconsumption in a capitalist society. Many of us are guilty of buying more
      than we need in the way of material possessions, and electronic devices are no exception. As a matter of fact, the
      average smartphone user upgrades to a new model every two years, despite the fact that it could be used for
      longer.
      Wastefulness is contributing to the U.S. producing devastating amounts of E-Waste, and this waste is mostly dumped
      in Eastern countries where it negatively affects the health and wellness of the community. We hope that this video
      causes you to consider more carefully the importance of ethical consumption and using what you have.</p>

    <h2> video two: inequity </h2>
    <p> Our second video was made to raise awareness regarding the working conditions miners are subject to in order to
      produce the minerals necessary for our phones and computers. Miners in countries like the Democratic Republic of
      the
      Congo (some of whom are children) risk their lives daily in order to source rare minerals like Cobalt, which are
      used for electronic devices in Western countries that many of these underprivileged miners have no access to.
      Despite this horror being a reality, many people choose to ignore the situation, and prefer to not think about the
      role that we play in supporting the unregulated mining industry as consumers of devices. We hope that this video
      makes you consider the fact that ignoring a situation does not make it go away, and that we are complicit in
      mistreatment if we turn a blind eye to it.</p>

    <h2> video three: blindness </h2>
    <p> Lastly, our third video explores the concept that the average American uses a phone of some sort every day, and
      yet has no clue what is inside it. Despite the fact that companies like Apple try to market devices as pure,
      simple, and minimalist, the truth is much less clean-cut. By remaining ignorant to what sorts of materials are
      inside our phones, we also lose the significance of knowing what sorts of labor go into making these devices, and
      we forfeit our ability to potentially fix and refurbish our phones if they malfunction. This video was designed as
      being the least dark and most satirical one, in the hopes that it could be catered to a younger population who may
      not find the other two videos palatable or easy to understand. We hope that watching this video leads you to
      wonder if you are really aware of what is in your phone, and also makes you think about why this could be
      important to know.</p>
